Software Development Life Cycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? I believe that taking into consideration the needs of the users is vital in order to create a successful program. User stories help by making the requirements more mangeable and break them down in the sections that state what the developer needs to do in order to make the program work that way that is needs to.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? After understanding the agile approach, I look t developing differently now. Now, my main focus is to create a funcitonal project. Changes or modifications can easily be made afterwards. Flexibility and planning is what I plan to incorporate into my future projects. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? What it means to be a good team member is the ability to collaborate, follow principles and have to ability to give and accept constructive criticism in a professional manner.
